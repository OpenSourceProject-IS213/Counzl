# How to contribute

The community is essential for Counzl to grow. We are currently looking for developers willing to participate!

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* This is usually the master branch.
* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical and reasonably sized units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

### Summary

* At the moment the only platform needed is GitHub. This might change at a later moment, but please keep yourself updated as this may change.
